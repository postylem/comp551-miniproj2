Our best classifier model is set up to run in the jupyter notebook `best-model.ipynb`. That notebook contains the scripts to process the data, and make the predictions, using the best-performing model pipeline that we could find. No external files are necessary to replicate the prediction we uploaded to Kaggle (except external python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, nltk, etc).
